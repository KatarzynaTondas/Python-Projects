# Customer Churn Analysis - python project

## Project Overview
- Main goal: This project aims to analyze customer churn using a dataset from a telecommunications company. The primary goal is to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn.
- Tools and programming language: The analysis was performed using a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries were used in this project:

- NumPy: For linear algebra operations.
- Pandas: For data processing and reading CSV files.
- Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Matplotlib: For creating plots.
- Missingno: For visualizing missing values.
- Plotly: For interactive visualizations.

## Steps Performed
### Data Loading and Initial Exploration:

- Loaded the dataset and checked its structure, including the shape, column names, and basic statistics.

#### Data Cleaning and Checking:

- Identified and visualized missing values to understand the completeness of the dataset.

#### Data Analysis:

- Churn Distribution: Analyzed the proportion of churn and non-churn customers.
- Gender Distribution: Examined the distribution of gender among customers.
- Senior Citizens: Visualized the percentage of senior citizens and their distribution among churned and non-churned customers.
- Tenure Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of customer tenure.
- Internet Service: Examined the distribution of different internet services among churned and non-churned customers.
- Contract Types: Analyzed the distribution of different contract types among churned and non-churned customers.
- Phone Service: Examined the distribution of phone service among customers and its relation to churn.

#### Visualizations
- Bar Plots: Used to visualize the distribution of churn, gender, internet service, contract types, and phone service.
- Pie Chart: Used to show the percentage of senior citizens.
- Histograms: Used to analyze the distribution of senior citizens and tenure.
- Scatter Plot: Used to visualize the tenure distribution.
- Interactive Plots: Created using Plotly for a more dynamic exploration of the data.
